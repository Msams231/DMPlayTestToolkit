# DMPlayTestToolkit
This is a work in project app that I developed as my final project for SDEV200


I plan on fully working on converting this app to mobile devices to be released for Android. This app is a tool for people who are interested in creating their own creations 
to be used in D&D. This apps only affiliation with D&D is through the base statistics for creations as well as the temporary use of a Bandit from the Monster Manual as a 
proof of concept for an enemy type.

This app allows the user to create homebrew content for their table top roleplaying experience and save those creations to a text file. This text file can then be read into
the app to allow the user to "test" their creation in combat against a standard bandit. This app also includes a built in dice "roller" to roll a D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and 
D20.
